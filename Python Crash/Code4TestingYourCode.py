#We will test our code before publishing 
#Here we will use {unittest} method



# Unit Tests and Test Cases
# The module unittest from the Python standard library provides tools for
# testing your code. A unit test verifies that one specific aspect of a function’s
# behavior is correct. A test case is a collection of unit tests that together prove
# that a function behaves as it’s supposed to, within the full range of situations
# you expect it to handle.

# we have successfully tested
#functions type 
#there are predefined (assertion methods)
#assertEqual(a,b), not
#assertTrue(x), false
#assertIn(item,list), not 


#For checking a class 
#we mostly chehck the individual functions 
# we will  create a class 
# then use it to, to do unittest  on classes
